There are 4 Main Models that can be followed to write any verilog code depending on their cases:

#### Gate Level Modelling:

- As seen in [**this code**](./Experiment%20Runs/Expt03/R1_Ckt_GateModelling.sv)

- Gate level modelling uses predefined modules, mainly the basic and universal gates

<br>

#### Dataflow Modelling:

- As seen in [**this code**](./Assignment%20Programs/Expt03/Q02_Eqn_Ckt_Dataflow.sv)

- Dataflow modelling uses the `assign` keyword followed by an equation made from **Bitwise** or **Logical** Operators

<br>

#### Behavioral Modelling:

- As seen in [**this code**](./Assignment%20Programs/Expt04/Q03_Full_Subtarctor_Behavior.sv)

- Behavioral modelling uses `if... else` or `case` statements

- These statements are defined inside of loops

  - `always` loop: executes repeatedly after starting at time 0

  - `initial` loop: executes only once after starting at time 0

#### Structural Modelling:

- As seen in [**this code**](./Self%20Evaluation%20Programs/Expt04/SE05_FullSubber_Struct.sv) and [**this code**](./Experiment%20Runs/Expt04/R3_parallel_adder)

- Structural modelling uses **multiple modules** (similar to methods or functions in other programming languages) defined in the file _(or different programs)_

- Any of the above mentioned modelling can be used to define these modules
