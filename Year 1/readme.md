# Computer Programming (CS F111) Lab Codes

Almost all the codes from the Computer Programming Lab in Year 1

The official repo for year 1 codes can be found at
[SivaaB's Repo](https://github.com/SivaaB/BITSPil-CSF111)

All these codes can be run on an [Online Complier](https://www.onlinegdb.com) in
C or can be downloaded and run in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or
such :)

## Note
These code files under Year 1 are no longer checked for bugs/errors, but if you
do find any, do raise an Issue. Or you may also create a Pull Request with the
changes yourself.
